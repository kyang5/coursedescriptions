M.S. in Information Technology
==============================

Overview
--------

The Master of Science in Information Technology is designed for current and aspiring professionals in charge of developing, implementing, operating, and managing information systems in a variety of organizations. Students in this program will gain a broad technical understanding of current and emerging technologies in the industry, familiarity with systems engineering concepts, and a solid foundation in net-centric computing. They will also have a firm grasp of current and future effects of the convergence of the telecommunications, media, and information technology sectors.

Courses may be taken in person or online.

Entirely Online Option
-----------------------

*The program can now be completed entirely online* with some decrease in available electives. Networking and security tracks may be completed online and full-time. The management tracks can be completed online at least part-time over two years. Students taking mostly regular face-to-face courses are also welcomed into online courses when they find that convenient, but students signed up explicitly for the entirely online option *get the advantage of being able to be registered before other students* who might happen to choose to take some of their courses online. Student in the entire online program should *contact the GPD with course choices* three days before the usual start of registration.

Curriculum
----------
