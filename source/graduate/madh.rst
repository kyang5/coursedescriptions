M.A. in Digital Humanities
##########################

The Computer Science department is a partner in the MA in Digital Humanities program. While not a department-specific the program, we encourage students with interdisciplinary interests at the intersection of culture and technology to consider this degree, which allows one to elect courses from the CS department.

The Digital Humanities M.A. program at Loyola University's Center for Textual Studies and Digital Humanities (CTSDH) combines theoretical and practical courses. Its aims are ultimately practical and professional, training new digital specialists for the growing knowledge and information economy and today's research in humanities disciplines. Because the nature of much Digital Humanities work is constructive and project-based, students in the M.A. program will be given hands-on training in the workshop or seminar-based classes, training in the text editing and text encoding, electronic publishing and platforms, programming, interface design, project management, and archive construction. At every stage, team-based collaborative learning will be encouraged, in-class projects, for example, and potentially in the required electronic thesis project. But the MA program also explores theoretical, critical, social, and ethical contexts for thinking about Digital Humanities research and applications, including issues of intellectual property, data, privacy, public access, and preservation.
