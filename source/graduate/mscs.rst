Overview
********

The M.S. in Computer Science provides foundations of Computer Science while acknowledging that Computer Science is key to algorithms in the sciences. Other programs in the Computer Science Department with different foci are :doc:`msit` and the :doc:`msse`.

The M.S. in Computer Science offers the following concentrations of specialization:

* :ref:`No Concentration<default>`
* :ref:`Artificial Intelligence<ai>`
* :ref:`Cybersecurity<cybersecurity>`
* :ref:`Computer Systems<computerSystems>`

.. _curriculum:

**********
Curriculum
**********

* Each program requires a total of 30 credit hours

  * Generally 10 three-credit courses

* Students can receive up to 6 credit hours (replacing two of our courses) for graduate work taken elsewhere

  * See the `transfer credit section of the Graduate Student Handbook <https://graduatehandbook.cs.luc.edu/regulations.html#transfer-credit>`_ for details.

.. important::

  Students who have taken undergraduate Loyola classes:

  Many 400-level courses in the department have closely related 300-level analogues, e.g. :doc:`../courses/comp443` and :doc:`../courses/comp343`. Students who enter the MS program after taking a Loyola course in this category must choose to take 400-level courses that are not closely related to any 300-level courses taken earlier, unless they have GPD permission.

.. warning::

    The Computer Science has more prerequisites than other programs.

Overall, to achieve depth and breadth, Computer Science students must complete the following to obtain the required 30 credits to graduate:

* Two (2) required courses
* Four (4) electives restricted to a concentration
* Four (4) general electives

.. _prereq:

Major Prerequisites
===================

A four-year undergraduate degree in any field. Computer science, software engineering, computer engineering, or related background recommended.

.. _prep:

Preparation Courses
-------------------

All of these courses must be taken if you do not have a four-year undergraduate degree in a related field.

* :doc:`../courses/comp400a`
* :doc:`../courses/comp400b`
* :doc:`../courses/comp400c`
* :doc:`../courses/comp400d`
* :doc:`../courses/comp400e`

.. warning::

  Students may not use an introductory course to satisfy a foundation or elective requirement.

  Preparatory courses do not count towards the 30 required credit hours of non-preparatory courses.

A student taking any necessary preparation course is considered to be a full-fledged student of the Graduate School. Preparation courses may be taken in the same semester as other graduate courses, provided the prerequisites for the other graduate courses are met. Students are expected, however, to take all necessary preparation courses early in their career.

A student may place out of an introductory course under any of the following conditions:

* The student has appropriate coursework equivalent to the introductory course.
* The student has appropriate and verified professional experience equivalent to the introductory course.
* The student passes a Graduate Competency Assessment (GCA) in the introductory course area.
* This can be waived under the discretion of the GPD.

If a student has had a preparatory course waived, departmental assistance will usually be necessary to allow the student to register for any other course having that preparatory course as a prerequisite.

.. _req:

Major Requirements
==================

The following two (2) courses are required by the program:

* :doc:`../courses/comp417`
* :doc:`../courses/comp460`

.. important::

    :doc:`../courses/comp460` has the prereq :doc:`../courses/comp363`.

Either class above can be substituted with another graduate course under the discretion of GPD if students had their equivalent in their undergraduate program.

.. _electives:

Major Electives
===============

MSCS students must take four (4) courses from their concentration, and four (4) courses of general electives.

General electives include any COMP 400 level course. The elective course options are common for all programs, differing only in the total number of credits required.

.. important::

  If a student does not puruse a specific concentration, the student must take four (4) courses from list the *Default Concentration* list of electives.

.. important::

    Several of these courses require :doc:`../courses/comp413` as a prerequisite.

There are numerous options for independent study, including a programming project, research, or a service-oriented project.

.. note::

  Students may take up to a maximum of 6 credit hours of :doc:`../courses/comp490` and/or :doc:`../courses/comp499`.

*************
Thesis Option
*************

MS students in the Computer Science degree program (only) may elect the MS thesis option.

Course work is strongly recommended over the thesis option, especially for those not planning on a research-oriented career. Many students pursuing the thesis option, therefore, would be considering a Ph.D. program at another institution.

Students wishing to do a thesis should discuss this option as early as possible with the GPD. These may involve research in purely theoretical computer science (for example, development or analysis of algorithms), or may involve the development of a software package, or may involve instrumentation, measurement, and analysis of existing systems (for example, studying network performance). Because of this wide range, there is no one a formal course in research methods. Courses in the restricted-electives list above contain a significant component of area-specific integrated research-methods material. Students interested in writing a thesis are strongly urged to seek advising from the GPD or other faculty as early as possible as to which electives in this group will be the most appropriate for the student's proposed area of research.

Here is an outline of the steps toward your thesis.  The ones in boldface are formal steps with the documentation required by the Graduate School:

1. If you wish to write a thesis, first identify a faculty advisor and select a tentative topic or area of research.The existing program allows you to take up to 6.0 hours of :doc:`../courses/comp490`. You will typically begin their research program in such a course, though you may also identify an advisor and select a tentative topic as part of a conventional classroom course.

2. Responsible Conduct in Research and Scholarship (RCRS) Training does not have to be done next, but it is required before graduation with a thesis.

See http://www.luc.edu/ors/RCRHome.shtml to find when this 2-day, non-credit course is offered.

3. Thesis/Dissertation Committee Recommendation

The next step is for you to secure permission to pursue the thesis option from the Graduate Program Director.

The Graduate Program Director, in consultation with you and your chosen advisor, recommends a thesis committee to the Graduate School. The committee will consist of at least three faculty members; normally the committee director will be the advisor.

.. important::

    **For the formal Graduate School process**

    1. You create the committee at https://gsps.luc.edu/

    2. An email will then be sent to the director for approval and then the GPD

    3. You will receive an email if your committee is formally approved by the Graduate School

4. At least 50% of the committee must be comprised of Loyola graduate faculty; the director of the committee must have full graduate faculty status – see http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/about\_facultystaff.shtml for the current list of full members.

5. You may finish while still taking :doc:`../courses/comp490` or other for-credit courses.

Alternately you may still be continuing with your research in subsequent semesters, after finishing all your required for-credit courses.

Then, assuming your *committee is approved*, you maintain full-time status by getting the GPD to register you for the zero-credit-hour Comp 595: Thesis Supervision, if available, or Comp 605: Masters Study, if Comp 595 is not listed. Students may register for any number of semesters of Comp 595/605, subject to time-to-degree-completion constraints.

6. Once you have your thesis committee approved, the thesis becomes a degree requirement. (This is important for international students.) You may, however, petition to revert to non-thesis status; this requires the permission of the Graduate Program Director. At that point, you would be able to graduate without writing a thesis, if the coursework requirements were met. No reimbursement or credit will be received for any Comp 595, Comp 605, or other thesis-specific courses taken.

7. A ballot for the Approval of a Thesis/Dissertation Proposal

You will then prepare a formal research proposal, in consultation with your advisor. This proposal must be submitted to your committee for review. This sequence is monitored through gsps.

If you are submitting your proposal to the Institutional Review Board (IRB), you must have approval or exemption *before* the Graduate School approves your proposal. You do not need to submit proof, Graduate School will confirm. (This step is required for the use of human and animal subjects, and is not common for Computer Science.)

.. important::

  A simple one to two paragraph abstract **must be included** in the proposal form on https://gsps.luc.edu/.

  You will get notified once all members of the committee, the GPD, and the Graduate School approve the proposal through https://gsps.luc.edu/.

After this step you are now ready to "conduct research" for the project.

8. A ballot for Text and Oral Defense Form

Upon completion of your thesis, you will be required to formally defend your research. Schedule this with your committee. Your thesis should be in nearly final form.Typically you should give the committee three weeks to read the final draft of the thesis before the defense date.

.. important::

  For this requirement, you must download the defense ballot at http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/T%20&%20D%20defense%20ballot--DB.pdf.

Bring your defense ballot with you to your defense. Your director and other committee member(s) will sign the ballot – this ballot then needs to go to the GPD for final approval.

The committee may require modifications before approving the thesis, or possibly reject it.

Once approved, the GPD will upload the ballot in gsps for Graduate School approval.

You will be notified once the process is complete.

9. Formatting the Thesis/Dissertation

Every thesis/dissertation needs to be formatted according to the rules stated in the Graduate School's formatting manual which can be found at http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/formatting.shtml.

**Format check is a required step**; the deadlines, depending on the conferral date, are posted on the Key Dates and Deadlines page on the Graduate School website. These deadlines are well before the end of the semester - be sure to check and satisfy them.

**Final Copy, both electronic and hard copies also have deadlines**, depending on the conferral date
