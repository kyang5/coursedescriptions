Description
--------------------

This course surveys the various levels of a packet-switched computer
network, using the TCP/IP protocol suite as the primary model. Other
network protocol stacks (e.g., Novell) may also be considered as time
permits. At the Physical and Data Link Layers, various protocols such as
Ethernet and Token Ring are compared, and their implications for network
topology are considered. At the Network Layer, a wide variety of routing
protocols and name resolution protocols are studied. At the Transport
Layer, students are introduced to the various methods for building
end-to-end reliability on top of less reliable lower layers. Finally, at
the Application Layer a variety of standard protocols such as telnet,
ftp, and electronic mail are examined, together with the related issues
of security and authentication. Some programming in the C language is
required.

Outcome
---------

Students will understand how the Internet is constructed, how data is routed to its destination, how connections are made, how congestion is handled, and how security can be addressed.
