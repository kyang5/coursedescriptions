Description
----------------------------

This course studies the architecture, design, and implementation of
multitiered server-based software systems. Each tier is studied along with the
pertinent mechanisms: markup languages in the client tier, web application
frameworks in the web tier, and server-side components in the business logic
and persistence tiers. Pervasive issues such as integration, testing,
security, and performance are discussed. Coursework includes several
substantial programming projects (using a platform such as Java 2 Enterprise
Edition).
