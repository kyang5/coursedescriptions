Masters Programs Overview
======================================

The `M.S. in Information Technology <http://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/graduateprograms/msit/msininformationtechnology/>`_ is 
management and business process facing.  
It is distinguished from a pure business degree by its requirement and 
frequent use of basic programming and other technical skills.  
If you end up managing technical workers, 
you will have an edge over those with pure business degrees.  Read to see
the general program and the special opportunities for a totally *online* version.

The :doc:`msse` 
is focused on knowledge and abilities to produce 
high quality software for many different domains.

The :doc:`mscs` is more foundational, 
requiring you to get experience with a broad range of core 
computer science concepts.  It is our only program with a :ref:`thesis_option`.  
Students from this program are the ones most likely to go on to a PhD program.


:doc:`masters_prereqs` are required for all programs.

Undergraduates presently in our department with strong background are urged to 
consider overlapping one of these programs with their undergraduate work 
via the  
:doc:`bsmsprograms`.

**Electives:** Computer Science is a broad and moving target. 
The full range of electives common to all programs is very helpful 
in providing breadth and flexibility. 
Only 3-5 courses out of 10 are specified or limited by the individual program. 
The overlap also means that it is generally fairly easy to switch programs 
if your interest is particularly stimulated by an elective more strongly 
associated with another program.

The :doc:`madh`
is a separate interdisciplinary program, partnered with Computer Science.

An important separate document is the 
`Graduate Handbook <http://gradhandbook.cs.luc.edu/html>`_.  See the description below.

Graduate Handbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tne `Graduate Handbook <http://gradhandbook.cs.luc.edu/html>`_ is a separate
document which has 
administrative and admissions information for the graduate program 
(also available in a  
`pdf version <http://gradhandbook.cs.luc.edu/latex/LoyolaComputerScienceGradHandbook.pdf>`_).

*Applicants* should particular;ly note the Graduate Handbook sections for 

* `Prospective students <http://gradhandbook.cs.luc.edu/html/prospective_students.html>`_ 
* `Teaching assistantships and financial aid <http://gradhandbook.cs.luc.edu/html/assistantships.html>`_

Once you are enrolled, the section for ongoing reference will be **Regulations and Procedures**, 
and the topics are
all listed in the table of contents at the beginning of the
`Graduate Handbook <http://gradhandbook.cs.luc.edu/html>`_.

.. index:: time for program

Time Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally it takes 16 months for full-time students to earn a 
M.S. in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Information Technology from Loyola. 
The M.S. in Computer Science 
may need extra time **if** the :ref:`thesis_option` is chosen.
Students who attend part time normally take 2-3 years. Though rarely an issue,
there is 
a five year overall time limit,
and
this period may be extended only by special action of the Dean of the Graduate School.


.. index:: multiple M.S. degrees

Pursuing Multiple M.S. Degrees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are often asked about whether it is possible to complete more than one M.S. degree 
(e.g. and M.S. in Computer Science and an M.S. in Software Engineering). 
The answer is no, unless you complete 54 hours of study (30 hours of courses for
the each degree, except for 6 credits transferred into the second degree). 
It is impractical and expensive, and we don't think it serves students well. 
Our goal is to prepare you
for a serious career (professional and/or academic) 
after completing *one* graduate degree.

.. index:: non-degree students
   continuing education

Non-Degree Students and Continuing Education
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Students who wish to continue taking courses may do so after completing their degree 
as non-degree students. We also
encourage our students to maintain connections through our professional 
and social networking groups. Many of our
students continue to be involved in research laboratories such as the 
Emerging Technologies Laboratory
(see http://www.etl.luc.edu).
