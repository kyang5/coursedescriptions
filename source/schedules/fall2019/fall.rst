    COMP 388-001: Computing Career Preparation

    (1 credit)



    Description:

    This course is designed specifically for students pursuing a degree in computing-related fields, for example, Computer Science, Information Technology,
    Software Engineering, and Cybersecurity.  They will learn about ways to develop themselves professionally, communicate their strengths, expand their
    contacts, and advance their careers.


    Prerequisites:

    It is best for students to have taken a course such as COMP 125 or COMP 150 or COMP 170 or COMP 180 so that they have begun to acquire some technical

    CRUD capabilities is developed.  Python will also be used to introduce MongoDB for data cleaning and querying, using the MongoDB Aggregation Framework as
    well as the MongoDB query language.  We will use Jupyter Notebooks for interactive testing, MongoDB Atlas as a cloud-based host, and Compass as a local GUI.
