Description
----------------------------

Computer graphics is the art and science of producing images using a computer.
We will study the theory of computer graphics, in particular 3D rendering,
while gaining a working knowledge of the OpenGL graphics library. Much of the
computer graphics we see in the media was created using software based on the
Open GL graphics library, which has quickly become an industry standard.

A word of warning-computer graphics makes considerable use of mathematics-
elementary linear algebra, vector analysis and differential calculus.

Other Information
------------------

There will be 7-8 programming assignments, a midterm, and a final. You will
probably do your assignments using Visual C++ under either Windows 95 or
Windows NT.
