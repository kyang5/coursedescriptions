Description
----------------------------

This course surveys the various levels of a packet-switched computer network,
using the TCP/IP protocol suite as the primary model. Other network protocol
stacks (e.g., Novell) may also be considered as time permits. At the Physical
and Data Link Layers, various protocols such as Ethernet and Token Ring are
compared, and their implications for network topology are considered. At the
Network Layer, a wide variety of routing protocols and name resolution
protocols are studied. At the Transport Layer, students are introduced to the
various methods for building end-to-end reliability on top of less reliable
lower layers. Finally, at the Application Layer a variety of standard
protocols such as telnet, ftp, and electronic mail are examined, together with
the related issues of security and authentication. Some programming in the C
language is required.
