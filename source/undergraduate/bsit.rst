    B.S. in Information Technology

B.S. in Information Technology
==============================

Overview
---------

This major prepares students who plan to design, create, and administer large information bases used by organizations.

Enterprises have an ever-growing investment in the exploding quantity of information, especially in web-related data, that requires increasingly sophisticated approaches for efficient access and productive use. Students gain the talents and skills to be successful in today’s organizations following current industry practices: planning, designing, implementing, and administering data information and knowledge bases that can be effectively mined; assessing the information and data requirements of an organization and implementing these requirements as an information system; functioning as an effective member of an information services division in an organization.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates high median pay and estimates a 15% increase (much higher than average) in the demand for computer and information systems managers for the period 2014 to 2024.

General Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Credits never can be double-counted for different categories of the requirements for the major. But a course may satisfy a major requirement and also satisfy a University and/or College requirement (e.g., Core, residency, Engaged Learning, Writing Intensive).

- It is usually not meant to combine a computing major or minor with another, the principal exception being CCFR-MINR; see more detail in the `double-dipping rules <https://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/undergraduateprograms/double-dippingrules>`_.
