    B.S. in Information Technology (Old)

B.S. in Information Technology (Old)
====================================

Overview
---------

This major prepares students who plan to design, create, and administer large information bases used by organizations.

Enterprises have an ever-growing investment in the exploding quantity of information, especially in web-related data, that requires increasingly sophisticated approaches for efficient access and productive use. Students gain the talents and skills to be successful in today’s organizations following current industry practices: planning, designing, implementing, and administering data information and knowledge bases that can be effectively mined; assessing the information and data requirements of an organization and implementing these requirements as an information system; functioning as an effective member of an information services division in an organization.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates high median pay and estimates a 15% increase (much higher than average) in the demand for computer and information systems managers for the period 2014 to 2024.
