About
=====

An introduction to the application and theory of algebraic coding theory.

Description
===========

In this course, major types of error-correcting codes, encoding and decoding, and their main properties will be studied. The codes examined will include the Hamming, Golay, BCH, cyclic, quadratic residue, Reed-Solomon, and Reed-Muller codes.

Outcome
=======

Students will learn both the theory and application of error-correcting codes.
