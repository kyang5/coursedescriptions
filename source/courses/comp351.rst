About
=====

This course introduces the current state of the art in automated management of computer networks, including protocols such as SNMP and its attendant naming conventions, network management systems, and important issues in administrative network configuration.

Description
===========

Networks today are high-speed, heterogeneous, large-scale, and delivers different media including data, audio, and video. How do you effectively manage today’s complex computer networks? This class provides complete yet accessible answers to network managers and researchers in this field. The course covers the basics of network management, alternative architectures, evaluation techniques, network management system components, SNMP and CMIP management protocols, and the ISO network management applications: fault management, performance management, configuration management, security management, and accounting management. The course emphasizes the practical experience of developing networks and distributed systems management tools using the SNMP++ and AdventNet wrappers. This course also highlights the latest advances in networks and distributed management areas and shows case studies of academic and industrial systems such as HiFi, SMARRT, OpenView, NetView, and Tivoli.

The class meets with INFS 793.

Outcome
=======

Students will become familiar with the SNMP protocol, with how large-scale Network Management Systems operate and are configured, and with advanced network configuration.
