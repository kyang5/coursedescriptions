About
=====

This course will cover techniques to analyze large data sets.

Description
===========

In this course, large data sets will be leveraged to solve challenging analytics problems. With more samples, analytics can use more complex learning models to automate more feature combinations for more robust model tuning, selection, and validation. Parallel, distributed processing will be performed with Apache Spark and Hadoop.

Outcome
=======

Python or R will be used with parallel frameworks to perform proper model selection when testing large combinations of features, models, hyperparameters, and ensembles, with additional emphasis on deep learning.
