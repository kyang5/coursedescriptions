About
=====

Many real-world software systems rely on concurrency for performance and modularity.  This programming-intensive course covers the analysis, design, implementation, and testing of concurrent software systems.

Description
===========

This course studies architecture, design, and implementation of concurrent software systems. Process algebras, formal specification, and testing are used as tools in the engineering of concurrent systems; event-based programming frameworks and thread libraries are employed in the implementation of such systems. Coursework includes several substantial programming projects (in a language such as Java) involving applications of concurrency and event-driven programming such as graphical user interfaces and distributed services using Remote Method Invocation (RMI).

Outcome
=======

An in-depth understanding of event-based and thread-based views of concurrency; the ability to develop concurrent software components using suitable languages, frameworks, and design patterns; familiarity with object-oriented modeling and development tools and test driven development.
