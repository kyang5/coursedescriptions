About
=====

This course continues some of the topics introduced in COMP 347.  The course covers methods and tactics to keep network attackers at bay and teaches mechanisms to identify and potentially stop potential intruders.  Analyses of specific attack mechanisms may be considered.

Description
===========

This course will involve a discussion of the methods and tactics used to keep attackers at bay as well as the mechanisms by which we can identify and potentially stop potential "bad guys." It will involve the following topics as they all relate to the overall security posture which makes computing safer: Encryption, authentication, firewalls, NAT/PAT, restricted access policies, intrusion detection, and other security frameworks. The goal is to gain an understanding of how to secure computers and computing environments. Instructor permission is based on relevant industry experience with networking including TCP/IP.

Outcome
=======

An understanding of how to secure networks using encryption, authentication, firewalls, NAT/PAT, restricted access policies, intrusion detection, and other security frameworks.
