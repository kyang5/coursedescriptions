About
=====

Description
===========

Machine learning is the process of making predictions and decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.  Topics include a variety of supervised learning methods.  Ensemble approaches are used to combine independent models efficiently.  Unsupervised and semi-supervised methods demonstrate the power of learning from data without an explicit training goal.

Outcome
=======

Students in this course will learn how to apply sophisticated algorithms to large data sets to make inferences for prediction or decision making.
