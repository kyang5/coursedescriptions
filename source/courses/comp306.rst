COMP 306: Data Mining (formerly numbered 300)
=============================================

This course covers theory and practice of extremely large information storage (warehousing) and analysis (mining) mechanisms. With data growing at exponential rates knowledge gathering and exploration techniques are essential for gaining useful intelligence.

Prerequisites

:doc:`../courses/comp251` or :doc:`../courses/comp271` and |stat103| or |stat203| or |isscm241| or |psyc304| or instructor permission.

Description
--------------------

Data warehousing and data mining are two major areas of exploration for
knowledge discovery in databases. These topics have gained great relevance
especially in the 1990’s and early 2000’s with web data growing at an
exponential rate. As more data is collected by businesses and scientific
institutions alike,knowledge exploration techniques are needed to gain useful
business intelligence. This course will cover a wide spectrum of industry
standard tchniques using widely available database and tools packages for
knowledge discovery.

Data mining is for relatively unstructured data for which more sophisticated
techniques are needed. The course aims to cover powerful data mining
techniques including clustering, association rules, and classification. It
then teaches high volume data processing mechanisms by building warehouse
schemas such as snowflake, and star. OLAP query retrieval techniques are also
introduced.

Outcome
----------------------

Students will be able to define and critically analyze data warehouse and mining approaches for fields such as security, forensics, privacy, and marketing.
