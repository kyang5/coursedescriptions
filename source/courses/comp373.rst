About
=====

Object-orientation continues to be a dominant approach to software development.  This advanced programming-intensive course studies object-oriented analysis, design, and implementation from a design patterns perspective.

You need to know Java, C#, or a similar object-oriented language, data structures, and fair sophistication with OOP - some experience with designing interacting, cooperating classes that would come in an intermediate discussion of software patterns. Software engineering is recommended but not required like the background listed above.

Description
===========

Object-oriented programming has become the dominant software development paradigm of the 1990s. This course assumes familiarity with the main constituents of the object-oriented methodology:

* OOP = abstraction + inheritance + polymorphism

Building on this foundation, the course studies three major topics:

Design Patterns
---------------

First, the course discusses patterns, reusable solutions to recurring software design problems. Common design patterns such as Composite, Decorator and Command typically involve several classes related by composition and inheritance.

Implementation
--------------

Next, the course examines how object-oriented language features such as composition, encapsulation, inheritance, and dynamic binding can be implemented. These features are studied in the context of an interpreter for a simplified object-oriented language.

Components
----------

Finally, the course explores programming with reusable components. Specifically, the standard features of component architectures are discussed: properties, events, methods, and persistence, and introspection.

Other Information
-----------------

This course is heavily project-oriented. Students study each major topic in the context of a substantial programming project. The reuse of existing class libraries and software components is emphasized.

Grading will be based upon the following components: programming projects, quizzes, in-class exams, and the final exam.

Outcome
=======

Proficiency in the use of object-oriented languages, frameworks, and patterns; advanced understanding of key language mechanisms such as delegation, inheritance, polymorphism, and reflection; familiarity with object-oriented modeling and development tools and test-driven development.
