About
=====

Server-based web applications and services have become part of everyday life.  This programming-intensive course covers analysis, design, implementation, and  testing of multi-tiered server-based software systems along with typical tier-specific technologies.

Description
===========

This course studies the architecture, design, and implementation of multi-tiered server-based software systems. Each tier is studied along with the pertinent mechanisms: markup languages in the client tier, web application frameworks in the web tier, and server-side components in the business logic and persistence tiers. Pervasive issues such as integration, testing, security, and performance are discussed. Coursework includes several substantial programming projects (using a platform such as Java 2 Enterprise Edition).

Outcome
=======

An understanding of software architecture and integration in the development of multi-tiered server-based software; familiarity with object-oriented modeling and development tools and test-driven development.
