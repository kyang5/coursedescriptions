About
=====

This course studies the design, development, and publication of client-side web applications.

Description
===========

The course has been structured to provide logical groupings of common technologies, which complement each other in the development of modern client-side applications. The student will begin by developing fundamental skills and knowledge in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (JS), and JSON. This allows a student to then progress to the more advanced implementations of current client-side technologies including React, D3.js, and other suitable JS based libraries.

We shall also consider client-side usage of tools and technologies such as Node.js, Express, and Mongoose. These technologies will be considered primarily from the client-side perspective with complimentary introductions to data stores such as Redis, MongoDB, and Firebase.

Outcome
=======

Students will acquire an awareness of different client-side design and development methods, technologies, and techniques suitable for the development of web applications.
