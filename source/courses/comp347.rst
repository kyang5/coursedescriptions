About
=====

This course covers techniques and algorithms for detecting unusual usage patterns that typically signal a break-in, including techniques for detecting evasive or stealthy attacks. Also covered are differences in detecting local versus network intruders. Additional topics: computer viruses, computer security management, computer forensics.

Description
===========

This course will cover techniques for detecting the unusual usage patterns that typically signal a break-in.  The course will also consider differences in the detection of local intruders versus intrusion over networks.  Finally, issues in the prosecution of those breaking into computers, particularly evidentiary issues are explored.

Outcome
=======

Students will learn to configure ID systems (e.g. SNORT) and analyze their output. They will also understand both network-based and host-based monitoring techniques.
