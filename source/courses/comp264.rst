About
=====

This course studies the hierarchy of abstractions and implementations that constitute a modern computer system, with a particular focus on issues of interest to programmers, typically including some systems programming instruction.

Description
===========

This course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the hierarchy of abstractions and implementations that comprise a modern computer system. The course is particularly geared towards topics of interest to a programmer, i.e., topics that affect the performance, correctness, or utility of user-level programs. Since this investigation is best carried out using the C programming language, the course will include some instruction in C for programming familiar with Java.

Outcome
=======

Understanding of system issues that affect the performance, correctness, or utility of user-level programs.
