About
=====

This course introduces key data structures such as lists, sets, and maps, as well as their implementations. Performance and analysis of algorithms are covered along with applications in sorting and searching.

Description
===========

This course studies advanced abstract data types, such as sets, maps, and graphs, and their implementation using arrays and dynamically allocated nodes in an object-oriented language. The course also studies the performance of the data structures’ built-in operations and related algorithms such as sorting, searching, and traversing.

Outcome
=======

Students learn non-linear data structures and runtime performance of their operations, solve computational problems by choosing suitable data structures and implement algorithms within the object-oriented paradigm
